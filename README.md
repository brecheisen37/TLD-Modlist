## What does it do?
When you click to pick up an item such as a stick, clothing, or food, or when you open a container for the first time the inspection menu normally appears, this allows you to stop that. It also allows you to pick up sticks and other items in a radius, courtesy of digitalzombie, the original creator of StickPick.
